* I'm an avid reader. One of my favourite series of books is the [discworld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld) set of novels. They are both funny and deeply philosophical. Its author, [Terry Pratchett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Pratchett), recently passed away (in 2015). I wish that progress in [medical imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging), to which I contribute, would have been more helpful in his case.

* I love cinema. My favourite film of all times is [Andrei Rublyev (Андрей Рублев)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Rublev_(film)), also [on IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060107/?ref_=nv_sr_2) by [Andrei Tarkovsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Tarkovsky). This is the one film that had the most effect on me. I often think of it. I've only seen it once in a theater, it is hard to find a place where it is projected, but if it shows somewhere near you, I urge you to go and see it. It lasts for 3 hours, but it is an experience. You can (legally !) watch it in HD online [here, at open culture](http://www.openculture.com/2010/07/tarkovksy.html), as well as 4 of Tarkovsky's other films, which are all very good indeed. I particularly recommend Solaris (Солярис) in that list.

* I'm an amateur musician, I play the [oboe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oboe) in a [local orchestra](http://www.harmonie-champs.fr/), I'm the webmaster and the treasurer of this association. Come and listen to us sometime!

* I'm an amateur astronomer and dabble in astrophotography. Actually astrophotography was one of the prime reason for me to go into computer vision. Unfortunately I live in the city and have little time to look at the sky these days, but I'm involved in a large European project putting together [astronomy and computer vision](https://www.astro.rug.nl/~peletier/sundial/index.html). When I was a teenager I was involved in an astronomy association, and we built our own 10" telescope, including grinding the mirror.

* I'm a huge geek and like to configure computers for fun, particularly big machine like [compute servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)). 

* I'm a fan of Wikipedia (did you notice?), and I try to contribute when I can. 

* Finally I have a wife and I'm a father of two great daughters. There are some pictures on my [FB page](https://www.facebook.com/hugues.talbot).
