Teacher and researcher
============

Teaching
-------

Currently I'm a professor of computer science at [ESIEE Paris](https://www.esiee.fr). Computer science is a very wide area. These days I mostly teach applied mathematics subjects such as [Mathematical Optimisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization) as well as image and [computer-vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision) related fields. In the past I have taught more traditionally computer-related topics such as [computer languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language) and [operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system). You can learn about my teaching in the [teaching](/teaching/) tab above.

Research
-------

Scientific Research is incredibly important. To me as a person, because this is what I've always dreamt of doing, and, I
believe, to society because this activity allows us to understand the world around us: how it came about, what are its
constituant, and how it works. My area of research is [computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision):
teaching the computers to see. This area of research is at the forefront of many disciplines, like biology, physics,
medicine, computer science, and of course mathematics. Currently it is very "hot" because much progress that has been
realized over the last few decades has recently come to fruition, particularly in
[machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning). You can learn more about my research in the
[research](/research/) tab above.

Other activities
===============

I'm an avid reader. One of my favourite series of books is the [discworld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld) set of novels. They are both funny and deeply philosophical. Its author, [Terry Pratchett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Pratchett), recently passed away (in 2015). I wish that progress in [medical imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging), to which I contribute, would have been more helpful in his case.
I'm an amateur musician, I play the [oboe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oboe) in a [local orchestra](http://www.harmonie-champs.fr/), I'm the webmaster and the treasurer of this association. Come and listen to us sometime!
I'm an amateur astronomer and dabble in astrophotography. Actually astrophotography was one of the prime reason for me to go into computer vision. Unfortunately I live in the city and have little time to look at the sky these days, but I'm involved in a large European project putting together [astronomy and computer vision](https://www.astro.rug.nl/~peletier/sundial/index.html). When I was a teenager I was involved in an astronomy association, and we built our own 10" telescope, including grinding the mirror.
I'm a huge geek and like to configure computers for fun, particularly big machine like [compute servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)). 
I'm a fan of Wikipedia (did you notice?), and I try to contribute when I can. 
Finally I have a wife and I'm a father of two great daughters. There are some pictures on my [FB page](https://www.facebook.com/hugues.talbot).
