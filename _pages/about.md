Introduction
============

Currently I'm a professor of computer science at [ESIEE Paris](https://www.esiee.fr). Computer science is a very wide area. These days I mostly teach applied mathematics subjects such as [Mathematical Optimisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization) as well as image and [computer-vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision) related fields.
