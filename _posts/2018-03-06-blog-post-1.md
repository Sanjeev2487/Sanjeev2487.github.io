This is a post to tell of my new web pages. After many years of using various CMS, I'm trying the semi-static route instead.

CMS vs static pages
======

* Pro of CMS:
  * all integrated
  * edit and publish
  * sophisticated and stylish, most of the time
* Cons of CMS:
  * needs lots of resources
  * slow to edit (depends on trafic)
  * tyranny of choice and Not Invented Here syndrome.
  * no versioning
 
Vs: 

* Pros of static pages
  * Lightweight
  * Simple
  * More freedom
* Cons of static pages
  * Usually unsophisticated (too much work !)
  * What if your template is on another computer ?
  * Can be a mess.
  * no versioning.

Not an easy choice !

At the end of the day?
======

Github pages are pretty good:
* They can be edited online or on your computer, your choice !
* They are versioned
* They are not pure HTML: Jekyl and markdown instead

They offer a good compromise.

Please tell me what you think.
